</tr>
<tr>
<td><h3>Benifits of IEEE membership</h3>
	<td>Join a community of over 420,000 technology and engineering professionals united by a common desire
	to continuously learn, interact, collaborate, and innovate,Get the resources and opportunities you need to keep on top of 
	changes in technology, get involved in stnadards development
</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><h3>one-to-many</h3>
	<td>In systems analysis, a one-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and
	 B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only 
	one element of A
</tr>
<tr>
<td><h3>many-to-many</h3>
	<td>In systems analysis, a many-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities, 
	say, A and B, where A may contain a parent instance for which there are many children in B and vice versa. For example, think of A as Authors, 
	and B as Books
</tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td><h3>Software Quality Assurance (SQA)</h3>
	<td>Software quality assurance is a means and practice of monitoring all software engineering processes, methods, and work products to ensure
	 compliance against defined standards
</tr>
<tr>
<td><h3>Software Testing:</h3>
	<td>Software testing is the act of examining the artifacts and the behavior of the software under test by validation and verification.
	 Software testing can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks 
	of software implementation
</tr>
