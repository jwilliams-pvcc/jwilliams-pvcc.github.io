<center><h1>Department of Defense</h1></center>

<p class="one">The Department of Defense (DoD) has the responsibility of providing the military forces that are needed to deter war and protect the United 
States of America. The Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force are the more noticeable branches that people may recognize. All four groups combined consist
of about 1.3 million active-duty men and women. Inactive duty, Reserve/National Guard, adds around 825,000 additional personnel. There are also man and women
who work directly for the United States Government as Civilians. (This basically means they do the same job set as Soldiers but are not required to perform 
extra duties like going to the motor pool or physical fitness) The count on these individuals is around 600,000 thousand. If you thought that was all then 
you would have guessed wrong, there are also contractors who work alongside both Soldiers and DoD Civilians. Counting how many individuals this accounts 
for would take a long time. There are 50,000 companies, as of FY15, that work with the government. Contract companies are a great asset for the government 
agencies because individual contractors do not count towards personnel numbers. Think back to when you heard the news and heard that the US was withdrawing 
their troop numbers in Afghanistan and Iraq. What they may not have mentioned as much was that as the official government employees left more contractors 
deployed to fill those spots left open. </p>

<center><h1>ARMY</h1></center>

<p class="one">The mission of the Department of the Army is to organize, train, 
and equip active duty and reserve forces for the preservation of peace, security, and the defense of our Nation. The Army focuses on land operations; 
its Soldiers must be trained with modern arms and equipment and be ready to respond quickly.

<center><h1>NAVY/MARINE CORPS</h1></center>

<p class="one">The primary mission of the Department of the Navy is to protect the United States by the effective prosecution of war at sea including, 
with its Marine Corps component (which make some Marines upset if you remind them), the seizure of defense of advanced naval bases; to support, as 
required, the forces of all military department of the United States.</p>

<center><h3>How Many Fleets Does the U.S. Navy Have?</h3></center>

<p class="three">The U.S. Navy has seven active, numbered fleets in its arsenal. 2nd Fleet, 3rd Fleet, 4th Fleet, 5th Fleet, 6th Fleet, 7th Fleet and 10th
Fleet. Certain numbered fleets, which were originally established during World War II, have since been deactivated or merged with other fleets, which is 
why today’s seven active fleets are not numbered in numerical order</p>

<center><h3>Is the U.S. Navy the Largest Navy in the World?</h3></center>
<p class="three">Technically, the U.S. Navy is the world’s second-largest navy – as of a 2021 Department of Defense report, China holds the title of the 
largest on the globe. However, most of China’s navy force is made up of small, coastal patrol ships and frigates, so although their numbers are slightly 
greater, the U.S. Navy’s fleets far outstrip theirs in power.</p>

</ol>

<center><h1>AIR FORCE</h1></center>

<p class="one">The Department of the Air Force is responsible for defending the United States through control and exploitation of air and space. The Department
of the Air Force (USAF) was established as part of the National Military Establishment by the National Security Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 502) and came into 
being on September 18, 1947. During the half century that the U.S. Air Force has existed as a separate service, 27 organizations designated as major commands 
have existed. As of January 2020, only nine major commands remain active.</p>
