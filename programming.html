<ul>
	<h2 style = "color:#262720;">Phases of computer program development</h2>
		<li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
		<li>Phase 2:Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
		<li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
		<li>Phase 4: Enter the prgram and save</li>
		<li>Phase 5:Execute the program</li>
		<li>Phase 6:Test the prgram, find error and debugm then retest</li>
		<li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
	<h2 style = "color:#262720;">Programming structures:</h2>
		<h3 style = "color:#BA0311;">Sequential structure: Top-down execution</h3>
		<h3 style = "color:#BA0311;">Decision structures: if/then/else</h3>
		<h3 style = "color:#BA0311;">Iterative (Looping):</h3>
			<li>while loop: continue loopins as long something is true</li>
			<li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
		<h3 style = "color:#BA0311;">Recursive structures:</h3>
			<li>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
			<li>Repetition continue until:</li>
				degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met
				(degenerative case is also called a "base case"
	<h2 style = "color:#262720;">Two classic programming/database problems</h2>
		<h3 style = "color:#BA0311;">Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</h3>
			<li>Sorting numbers</li>
			<li>Sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
		<h3 style = "color:#BA0311;">Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria</h3>
			<li>In database:</li>
				Filters: temporary search
				Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated
		<h3 style = "color:#BA0311;">Two popular search techniques:</h3>
			<li>Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
			<li>Binary search:</li>
				only works if data is SORTED first
				start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.
